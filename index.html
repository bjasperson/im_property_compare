<h1>Exploring correlations between interatomic model predicted properties</h1>

<p> 
Shared repositories for molecular simulation data presents an opportunity to 
reinvent material science and mechanics research. Researchers can now probe numerous 
models and their results with ease.
<p>
However, it is important to understand the nuances that define the data that we leverage. 
As an example, we explore the observed correlations between elastic constants 
(C44 in particular) and surface energy.
</p>
<p> 
Below, we see average values across species from OpenKIM, a database of interatomic 
models and test results.

<p>
Letâ€™s expand the data points to show the underlying results that were aggregated.
</p>
<p>
Hover over each data point to see the model details

<p>
If we remove the data points which came from one model and result in large values, we see a different 
relationship between C44 and Average Surface Energy.

Explore the underlying data by hovering over each datapoint, to see the model details 
(note the use of a log/log plot to facilitate data visualization).
