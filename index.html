<h1>Exploring Correlations Between Predicted Properties from Interatomic Models</h1>

<p> 
Shared repositories for molecular simulation data present an opportunity to 
reinvent material science and mechanics research. Researchers can now probe numerous 
models and their predicted properties with ease. This opens up the possibility of 
using ensembles to aggregate and estimate property values.
<p>
However, it is important to understand the nuances that define the data that we leverage. 
As an example, we explore the observed correlations between elastic constants 
(C44 in particular) and surface energy.
</p>
<p> 
Below, we see average values across species from OpenKIM, a database of interatomic 
models and test results. Hover over each point to see which species it corresponds to. 
</p>
<p>
Click "raw" to expand the data points to show the underlying 
results that were aggregated. Hover over each data point to see the specific model
name for that point.
